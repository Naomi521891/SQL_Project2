# SQL_Project2
This project analyses U.S. baby names data using SQL to uncover trends in popularity, gender distribution, and yearly birth patterns. The analysis uses real kaggles datasets and applies SQL techniques such as joins, aggregation, filtering, grouping, and ranking to answer practical data questions.

This project shows the following:

-Retriving all te data from the two ables 
-Most and least popular baby names
-Gender-based name trends
-Birth totals by year
-Comparison between full and most-popular datasets
-Identification of top names per year

This project demonstrates hands-on SQL skills.

Tools that I used: SQL Server (SSMS)
